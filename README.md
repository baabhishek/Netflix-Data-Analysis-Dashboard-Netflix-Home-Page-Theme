# Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Our data universe comprises 12 columns and 8000 + rows, revealing the essence of movies and TV shows:
1. Show ID: Unique identifier
2. Type: Movie or TV show
3. Title: Name of the show
4. Director: Name of the directors
5. Cast: Name of the lead cast
6. Country: Countries where the show is released
7. Date: Date of show release
8. Release Year: The year the show was added to Netflix
9. Rating: Show rating
10. Duration: Duration of the show in minutes
11. Description: Brief overview of the show
12. Genre: Category to which the show belongs
    
To optimize the data visualization process, a thorough cleansing was performed. Superfluous blank columns and rows were systematically eliminated through filtration. The segmentation of countries into distinct cells was implemented, enhancing Power BI's ability to efficiently detect and process country-specific data, resulting in more accurate and meaningful outputs.
